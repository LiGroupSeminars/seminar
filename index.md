            <p><b> Abstract: We examine the trade-off between the provision of incentives to exert costly effort (ex-ante moral hazard) and the incentives needed to prevent the agent from manipulating the profit observed by the principal (ex-post moral hazard). Formally, we build a model of two-stage hidden actions where the agent can both influence the expected revenue of a business and manipulate its observed profit. We show that manipulation-proofness is sensitive to the interaction between the manipulation technology and the probability distribution of the stochastic output. The optimal contract is manipulation-proof whenever the manipulation technology is linear. However, a convex manipulation technology sometimes leads to contracts for which there is manipulation in equilibrium. Whenever the distribution satisfies the monotone likelihood ratio property we can always find a manipulation technology for which this is the case. </b></p>

            <p><b> Speaker: Felix-Benedikt Liebrich (Research Fellow, Leibniz University Hannover) </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: Over the past decade, the debate of the role that convexity plays in risk measure theory has intensified. We follow two recent contributions of Mao & Wang (2020) and Castagnoli et al. (2021) and try to explore the mathematical power of assumptions like star-shapedness of a risk measure and consistency with second-order stochastic dominance. The first part of the talk focuses on the „collapse of the mean“. The latter refers to the fundamental tension existing between law invariance of functionals and suitable “linearity” properties; in many cases, the expectation turns out to be the only functional with both properties. We shall discuss this phenomenon for consistent risk measures and a broad class of nonconvex Choquet integrals. In the second part, we approach the classical problem of finding Pareto-optimal allocations of risk among finitely many agents. The associated individual risk measures are assumed to be consistent, but with respect to agent-dependent and potentially heterogeneous concordant reference probability measures. Moreover, convexity is replaced by star-shapedness. We provide a simple sufficient condition for the existence of Pareto optima and sketch its proof, which is based on local comonotone improvement combined with a Dieudonné-type argument based on the „collapse to the mean“ established in the first part. The talk is partially based on joint work with Cosimo Munari. </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: Expected Shortfall (ES) is the most important coherent risk measure in both industry practice and academic research in finance, insurance, risk management, and engineering. In Wang and Zitikis (2020) , they put forward four intuitive economic axioms for portfolio risk assessment  that  provides the first economic axiomatic foundation for the family of ES. In this paper, we  incorporate the  notion of $p$-concentration aversion ($p$-CA) to present a new axiomatic characterization of risk measures. The risk measure characterized can be regarded as the functionals of  ES and expectation. We  further show that  if the risk measure also satisfies the axioms -- monotonicity, translation-invariance and prudence,  then it uniquely characterizes the family of ES.  In contrast to  Wang and Zitikis (2020),  we  use  the $p$-CA to replace the  no reward for concentration axiom  NRC, which  makes the axiomatic foundation for ES more natural to be  illustrated  for portfolio risk assessment. </b></p>

            <p><b> Location: Online via Zoom </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: A risk analyst assesses potential financial losses based on multiple sources of information. In particular, the assessment does not only depend on the loss random variable, but also various economic scenarios. Motivated by this observation, we design a unified axiomatic framework for evaluation principles which quantifies jointly a loss random variable and a set of plausible probabilities. We call such an evaluation principle a generalized risk measure. As the most practical choice, the worst-case generalized risk measure is characterized via a few intuitive axioms. We reveal the relationship between a few natural forms of law invariance, under which we further pin down particular forms of the worst-case generalized risk measures. Some connections to decision theory are discussed, and many open questions remain.  </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: The Expected Shortfall (ES) is one of the most important risk measures widely applied in the field of finance, insurance, statistics, and risk management. In light of recent results characterizing ES in the context of financial regulation and statistics, we examine the implication of ES in insurance and actuarial science. In this paper, we study a reinsurance contract design problem focusing on the risk measure used by an overseer. One of our major results is that we characterize a mixture of the mean and ES as the risk measure of the overseer, where the optimal contracts are within the common set of ceded loss functions with a deductible form. Characterization results of other classes of risk measures including the mean and the distortion risk measures are demonstrated as the optimal set of ceded loss functions changes. Extension to the case with multiple reinsurers and alternative explanations of the optimal contract condition from the perspective of the insurer are also discussed.  </b></p>

            <p><b> Location: Online via Zoom </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: A basic assumption of the classic reinsurance model is that the distribution of the loss is precisely known. In practice, only partial information is available for the loss distribution  due to the lack of data and estimation error. We study a distributionally robust reinsurance problem   by minimizing the maximum Value-at-Risk (or the worst-case VaR) of the total retained loss of the insurer  for all loss distributions with known mean and variance. Our model handles  typical stop-loss reinsurance contracts. We show that a three-point distribution achieves the worst-case VaR of  the total retained loss of the insurer,  from which the closed-form solutions of the worst-case distribution and optimal deductible are  obtained. Moreover, we show that the worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk of the total retained loss of the insurer  is equal to the worst-case VaR, and thus the optimal deductible is the same in both cases. This talk is based on joint work with Tiantian Mao.  </b></p>

We derive the fundamental equivalence of economic viability of asset prices and absence of arbitrage. We also obtain a modified version of the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing using the notion of sublinear pricing measures.

            <p><b> Location: Online via Zoom </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: In this talk, we propose a new class of measures of bivariate tail dependence called tail concordance measure (TCM), which is defined as the limit of a measure of concordance of the underlying copula restricted to the tail region of interest.  The proposed measures capture the extremal relationship between random variables not only along the diagonal but also along all angles weighted by a tail generating measure.  Axioms of tail dependence measures are introduced, and the TCMs are shown to characterize linear tail dependence measures.  The infimum and supremum of the TCMs over all generating measures are presented to investigate the issue of under- and overestimation of the degree of extreme co-movements. The infimum is shown to be attained by the classical tail dependence coefficient, and thus the classical notion always underestimates tail dependence.  A formula for the supremum TCM is derived and shown to overestimate the degree of extreme co-movements.  Estimators of the proposed measures are studied, and their performance is demonstrated in numerical experiments.  For a fair assessment of tail dependence and stability of the estimation under small sample sizes, TCMs weighted over all angles are suggested, with tail Spearman's rho and tail Gini's gamma being novel special cases of TCMs.  </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss some practical and theoretical issues related to insurance as a risk management practice at the time of macro-economic systematic events like COVID-19. First, I will briefly discuss the modeling, decision-making, economic and political issues. The investigation of these issues would suggest revisiting the insurance as a general approach to risk management of systematic events. Particularly, we will revisit the so-called “insurance principle” and the ex-ante insurance policies in the presence of the common shocks, by introducing the ex-post policies. From a mathematical standpoint, I will be spending some time reviewing central limit theorems as well as the asymptotic equivalence of value at risk. We see how new concepts like contingent premiums, and VaR conditional on an event, naturally arise from our discussions and will be used for risk management of the systematic risk.  </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: In this talk, we study the aggregation of two risks when the marginal distributions are known, and one risk is assumed to be smaller than the other. The concave ordering of the aggregate position is discussed. In particular, the largest aggregate risk in concave order is attained when the two risks are directionally lower (DL) coupled. These results are used to calculate the best-case and worst-case values of risk measures. Moreover, we derive an analytical solution for Value-at-Risk. Our numerical results suggest that the new bounds on risk measures with the extra order constraint can greatly improve those where only the marginal distributions are known. </b></p>
