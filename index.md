# Weekly Seminars on <br/> Risk Management and Actuarial Science

<b>The weekly seminar series is a venue for international scholars in risk management and actuarial science to discuss research advances and exchange ideas. Junior researchers are the most encouraged to present their recent work, including on-going projects. The list of current and past speakers includes scholars from Canada, US, China, Australia, and Europe. </b>

* <b>To volunteer yourself or propose a speaker for a research presentation, please contact the organizers by email. </b>

* <b>We will send out weekly reminders via a mailing list, usually on the day before the presentation. Papers and presentation slides will be circulated among participants via the mailing list. If you would like to be included in the list, please contact the organizers.</b>

            <p><b> Title: Tail concordance measures: A fair assessment of tail dependence </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: <a href="https://researchmap.jp/takaakikoike?lang=en">Takaaki Koike</a> (Project Assistant Professor, Institute of Statistical Mathematics) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 9:00am-10:00am EST, April 7 (Wed) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: Online via Zoom </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: In this talk, we propose a new class of measures of bivariate tail dependence called tail concordance measure (TCM), which is defined as the limit of a measure of concordance of the underlying copula restricted to the tail region of interest.  The proposed measures capture the extremal relationship between random variables not only along the diagonal but also along all angles weighted by a tail generating measure.  Axioms of tail dependence measures are introduced, and the TCMs are shown to characterize linear tail dependence measures.  The infimum and supremum of the TCMs over all generating measures are presented to investigate the issue of under- and overestimation of the degree of extreme co-movements. The infimum is shown to be attained by the classical tail dependence coefficient, and thus the classical notion always underestimates tail dependence.  A formula for the supremum TCM is derived and shown to overestimate the degree of extreme co-movements.  Estimators of the proposed measures are studied, and their performance is demonstrated in numerical experiments.  For a fair assessment of tail dependence and stability of the estimation under small sample sizes, TCMs weighted over all angles are suggested, with tail Spearman's rho and tail Gini's gamma being novel special cases of TCMs.  </b></p>

            <p><b> Speaker: <a href="http://www.hirbod-assa.com/index.html">Hirbod Assa</a> (Professor, Kent Business School) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 9:00am-10:00am EST, Mar 31 (Wed) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: Online via Zoom </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss some practical and theoretical issues related to insurance as a risk management practice at the time of macro-economic systematic events like COVID-19. First, I will briefly discuss the modeling, decision-making, economic and political issues. The investigation of these issues would suggest revisiting the insurance as a general approach to risk management of systematic events. Particularly, we will revisit the so-called “insurance principle” and the ex-ante insurance policies in the presence of the common shocks, by introducing the ex-post policies. From a mathematical standpoint, I will be spending some time reviewing central limit theorems as well as the asymptotic equivalence of value at risk. We see how new concepts like contingent premiums, and VaR conditional on an event, naturally arise from our discussions and will be used for risk management of the systematic risk.  </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: Aggregation of Two Ordered Risks with Dependence Uncertainty </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: <a href = "https://yuyuchen-uw.github.io/"> Yuyu Chen</a> (PhD Candidate, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 9:00am-10:00am EST, Mar 24 (Wed) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: Online via Zoom </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: In this talk, we study the aggregation of two risks when the marginal distributions are known, and one risk is assumed to be smaller than the other. The concave ordering of the aggregate position is discussed. In particular, the largest aggregate risk in concave order is attained when the two risks are directionally lower (DL) coupled. These results are used to calculate the best-case and worst-case values of risk measures. Moreover, we derive an analytical solution for Value-at-Risk. Our numerical results suggest that the new bounds on risk measures with the extra order constraint can greatly improve those where only the marginal distributions are known. </b></p>
