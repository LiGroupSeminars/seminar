# Weekly Seminars on Risk Management and Actuarial Science

The weekly seminar series is a venue for international scholars in risk management and actuarial science to discuss research advances and exchange ideas. Junior researchers are the most encouraged to present their recent work, including on-going projects. The list of current and past speakers includes scholars from Canada, US, China, Australia, and Europe. 

* To volunteer yourself or propose a speaker for a research presentation, please contact the organizers by email. 

* If you would like to be included in the mailing list, please contact the organizers.

> Abstract: We consider the following question: given information on individual policyholder characteristics, how can we ensure that insurance prices do not discriminate with respect to protected characteristics, such as gender? We address the issues of direct and indirect discrimination, the latter meaning that protected characteristics are implicitly learned (“proxied”) from non-protected ones. We provide mathematical definitions for direct and indirect discrimination and introduce a simple formula for discrimination-free pricing, which avoids both direct and indirect discrimination. This formula works in any statistical model. We demonstrate its application on a health insurance example, using a generalized linear model and a neural network regression model. An important conclusion is that discrimination-free pricing in general requires collection of policyholders’ discriminatory characteristics, posing potential challenges in relation to policyholder’s privacy concerns. Moving towards application of this approach in practice raises further questions, which I aim to discuss in the seminar. This is a joint work with M. Lindholm, R. Richman, M.V. Wuethrich.
