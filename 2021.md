            <p><b> Speaker: <a href="http://www.hirbod-assa.com/index.html">Hirbod Assa</a> (Professor, Kent Business School) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 9:00am-10:00am EST, Mar 31 (Wed) </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss some practical and theoretical issues related to insurance as a risk management practice at the time of macro-economic systematic events like COVID-19. First, I will briefly discuss the modeling, decision-making, economic and political issues. The investigation of these issues would suggest revisiting the insurance as a general approach to risk management of systematic events. Particularly, we will revisit the so-called “insurance principle” and the ex-ante insurance policies in the presence of the common shocks, by introducing the ex-post policies. From a mathematical standpoint, I will be spending some time reviewing central limit theorems as well as the asymptotic equivalence of value at risk. We see how new concepts like contingent premiums, and VaR conditional on an event, naturally arise from our discussions and will be used for risk management of the systematic risk.  </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: Aggregation of Two Ordered Risks with Dependence Uncertainty </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Yuyu Chen (PhD Candidate, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 9:00am-10:00am EST, Mar 24 (Wed) </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: In this talk, we study the aggregation of two risks when the marginal distributions are known, and one risk is assumed to be smaller than the other. The concave ordering of the aggregate position is discussed. In particular, the largest aggregate risk in concave order is attained when the two risks are directionally lower (DL) coupled. These results are used to calculate the best-case and worst-case values of risk measures. Moreover, we derive an analytical solution for Value-at-Risk. Our numerical results suggest that the new bounds on risk measures with the extra order constraint can greatly improve those where only the marginal distributions are known. </b></p>
