            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
              In this talk, I will talk about the problem of identifying and estimating the treatment effect of a certain intervention (e.g., new product design or new therapy) on some long-term outcome of interest (e.g., users' long-term satisfaction or patients' long-term health). This problem is very challenging: randomized experiments are often expensive and have short durations, so long-term outcome observations may not be available; observational studies can be cheaper and more likely to collect observations for long-term outcomes, but they are susceptible to confounding bias. In the first part of this talk, I will review some very recent literature that address this challenge by combining experimental and observational data and leveraging their complementary strengths. I will discuss major assumptions in the literature and discuss their strengths and limitations. In the second part of this talk, I will present my latest work on long-term causal inference under a confounding model more general than those in the existing literature. </p>

            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
              The trust game, a simple two-person economic exchange, has been extensively used as experimental measures for trust and trustworthiness of individuals. Here, we develop deep neural network-based artificial intelligence (AI) agents to participate a series of experiments based upon the trust game. These artificial agents are trained by playing with one another without any prior knowledge or assumption regarding trust. We find that artificial agents can mimic trusting and trustworthy behaviors and produce actions that are close to decisions by human subjects. Conditions that influence levels of trust and trustworthiness by AIs are further explored. This study offers evidence that trust can emerge purely from an interactive learning process and demonstrates the possibility to build AI-integrated decision support systems capable of leveraging social behaviors to achieve better outcomes collectively. </p>

            <p> <b>Speaker:</b> <a href = "https://rihuan.me/"> Mr. Rihuan Huang </a> (SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University) </p>

            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
              When multiple retailers hold inventory to satisfy random demand, retailer inventory-sharing strategies can potentially reduce the supply-demand mismatch and increase overall supply chain performance. In this paper, we experimentally investigate alternative inventory-sharing strategies in a two-tier supply chain with an upstream manufacturer and two downstream retailers. In one setting, retailers act as if they are centralized and use a single quantity to fulfill joint demand. In the other, retailers are decentralized and face separate demands, but they can transfer inventory after demands are realized. In this latter decentralized scenario, we also consider whether the manufacturer or retailers have decision authority over the inventory transfer price. One key result is that when the retailers are decentralized and the manufacturer sets the transfer price, both retailers and the manufacturer earn higher profits than in the centralized retailer strategy, which runs counter to theory. We also find that when retailers are decentralized and set their own transfer price, the most equitable distribution of profits is achieved. In an effort to account for these results, we find that a model of fairness captures decisions well. Overall, by investigating how different inventory-sharing strategies affect the distribution of profits in a two-tier supply chain, our results provide guidance to firms considering how, if at all, they should enter such arrangements. </p>

            <p> <b>Speaker:</b> <a href = "https://www.dmitriisumkin.com/"> Dmitrii Sumkin </a> (Ph.D. Candidate in Technology in Operations Management at INSEAD) </p>
            <p> <b>Time:</b> 9:00am-10:00am CST, March 29 (Tue) </p>
            <p> <b>Location:</b> Online via Zoom </p>
            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
              <b><i>Problem definition:</i></b> Blockchain technology has become widely accepted to demonstrate the provenance of physical goods, but there are open questions about its practical implementation and overall effect on ethical sourcing. In the diamond industry, blockchain enables credibility of the certificate of origin and therefore, allows to charge a premium for responsibly produced goods. Thus, one would expect blockchain to be the enabler of responsible sourcing. But does blockchain provide better incentives to the retailer to work only with socially responsible suppliers? As we demonstrate, seeming benefits of blockchain adoption can have unintended consequences when the consumer market is heterogeneous in valuing responsible sourcing and when there are reselling opportunities.<br>
              <b><i>Methodology/results:</i></b> Using a stylized economic model, we demonstrate that, counter-intuitively, blockchain implementation may reduce incentives for customers to resell diamonds on the secondary markets and increase the cost of market segmentation. As a result, blockchain implementation could change a retailer’s market segmentation strategy by increasing incentives to source from non-responsible suppliers. We also demonstrate that to reduce unintended consequences of blockchain implementation, the social planner should offer blockchain as an option (and not as a requirement) to a retailer.<br>
              <b><i>Managerial implications:</i></b> This work shows that caution is needed with wide-scale blockchain implementation. Although it is commonly recognized that blockchain’s major application is in enhancing the traceability of durable goods or goods that should have a responsible supplier, we show that, in contrast, when factors of durability and responsibility come together, blockchain may negatively influence the responsibility level. </p>

            <p> <b>Speaker:</b> <a href = "https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/zhangchenglong"> Chenglong Zhang </a> (Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong) </p>
            <p> <b>Time:</b> 9:00pm-10:30pm CST, March 16 (Wed) </p>
            <p> <b>Location:</b> Online via Zoom </p>
            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> The concept of fairness has been addressed by many disciplines on various dimensions, including determining how individuals react under various scenarios, the fair distribution of resources, and designing intelligent systems that make fair decisions. However, prior studies have not attempted to formally represent individuals' view of a fair decision mathematically nor determined how to represent the degree to which a decision is viewed as fair by individuals. Based on the concept that "fairness is in the eye of the beholder," we provide a framework to formally represent individuals' view of the fairness of a decision using the scheme in Dempster and Schafer's theory of evidence. This allows us to not only capture the strength of the individual's fairness belief but also represent the person's indifference to the outcome of the decision. We further illustrate how a decision maker can use the knowledge of the fairness beliefs of a group of individuals to make an optimal decision on the fairness criteria. We believe the proposed model can be used in various domains including the design and verification of intelligent system decisions and identifying reactions to policy decisions, as well as determining reactions to posts on controversial topics on social media. We also used data from Tweeter and Youtube to validate and operationalize our model. </p>

            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> Crowding in the emergency department (ED) has been a significant and growing problem for the hospitals in the United States and around the world. In recent years, the full capacity protocol (FCP), a set of hospital-wide guidelines to alleviate ED crowding, has seen rather wide adoption as an intervention to ease crowding and access block in the ED. Yet, academic literature evaluating its effectiveness is sparse. Using the data from an ED of a large urban teaching hospital in the United States, we seek to fill this gap in literature. An instrumented difference-in-difference approach is applied to investigate the operational effectiveness of the FCP. Comparing the patients who arrived when the FCP was on to those similar visits in absence of FCP, we show that the FCP is effective in reducing patient length of stay (LOS). We also examine the role of laboratory tests during a patient visit, and how laboratory tests affect the patient LOS in presence of the FCP. The FCP can be adopted relatively easily by any hospitals in the sense that it requires minimal capital expenditure for adoptions. Our modeling framework is general enough to handle the idiosyncrasies of different hospitals. </p>
