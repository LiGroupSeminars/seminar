            <p> <b>Title: Does Blockchain Facilitate Responsible Sourcing? An Application to the Diamond Supply Chain </b></p>

            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
              <b><i>Problem definition:</i></b> Blockchain technology has become widely accepted to demonstrate the provenance of physical goods, but there are open questions about its practical implementation and overall effect on ethical sourcing. In the diamond industry, blockchain enables credibility of the certificate of origin and therefore, allows to charge a premium for responsibly produced goods. Thus, one would expect blockchain to be the enabler of responsible sourcing. But does blockchain provide better incentives to the retailer to work only with socially responsible suppliers? As we demonstrate, seeming benefits of blockchain adoption can have unintended consequences when the consumer market is heterogeneous in valuing responsible sourcing and when there are reselling opportunities.<br>
              <b><i>Methodology/results:</i></b> Using a stylized economic model, we demonstrate that, counter-intuitively, blockchain implementation may reduce incentives for customers to resell diamonds on the secondary markets and increase the cost of market segmentation. As a result, blockchain implementation could change a retailer’s market segmentation strategy by increasing incentives to source from non-responsible suppliers. We also demonstrate that to reduce unintended consequences of blockchain implementation, the social planner should offer blockchain as an option (and not as a requirement) to a retailer.<br>
              <b><i>Managerial implications:</i></b> This work shows that caution is needed with wide-scale blockchain implementation. Although it is commonly recognized that blockchain’s major application is in enhancing the traceability of durable goods or goods that should have a responsible supplier, we show that, in contrast, when factors of durability and responsibility come together, blockchain may negatively influence the responsibility level. </p>

            <p> <b>Title:</b> Is That Decision Fair? A Formal Model to Assess an Individual's Belief on the Fairness of a Decision </b></p>
            <p> <b>Speaker:</b> <a href = "https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/zhangchenglong"> Chenglong Zhang </a> (Assistant Professor, The Chinese University of Hong Kong) </p>
            <p> <b>Time:</b> 9:00pm-10:30pm CST, March 16 (Wed) </p>
            <p> <b>Location:</b> Online via Zoom </p>
            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> The concept of fairness has been addressed by many disciplines on various dimensions, including determining how individuals react under various scenarios, the fair distribution of resources, and designing intelligent systems that make fair decisions. However, prior studies have not attempted to formally represent individuals' view of a fair decision mathematically nor determined how to represent the degree to which a decision is viewed as fair by individuals. Based on the concept that "fairness is in the eye of the beholder," we provide a framework to formally represent individuals' view of the fairness of a decision using the scheme in Dempster and Schafer's theory of evidence. This allows us to not only capture the strength of the individual's fairness belief but also represent the person's indifference to the outcome of the decision. We further illustrate how a decision maker can use the knowledge of the fairness beliefs of a group of individuals to make an optimal decision on the fairness criteria. We believe the proposed model can be used in various domains including the design and verification of intelligent system decisions and identifying reactions to policy decisions, as well as determining reactions to posts on controversial topics on social media. We also used data from Tweeter and Youtube to validate and operationalize our model. </p>

            <p> <b>Title:</b> The Operational Effectiveness of a Full Capacity Protocol to Ease the Crowding at an Emergency Department </b></p>
            <p> <b>Speaker:</b> <a href = "https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/isom/about-us/faculty-and-staff/lu-wang"> Lu Wang </a> (Assistant Professor, Ball State University) </p>
            <p> <b>Time:</b> 9:00pm-10:30pm CST, March 8 (Tue) </p>
            <p> <b>Location:</b> Online via the Tencent meeting </p>
            <p> <b>Abstract:</b> Crowding in the emergency department (ED) has been a significant and growing problem for the hospitals in the United States and around the world. In recent years, the full capacity protocol (FCP), a set of hospital-wide guidelines to alleviate ED crowding, has seen rather wide adoption as an intervention to ease crowding and access block in the ED. Yet, academic literature evaluating its effectiveness is sparse. Using the data from an ED of a large urban teaching hospital in the United States, we seek to fill this gap in literature. An instrumented difference-in-difference approach is applied to investigate the operational effectiveness of the FCP. Comparing the patients who arrived when the FCP was on to those similar visits in absence of FCP, we show that the FCP is effective in reducing patient length of stay (LOS). We also examine the role of laboratory tests during a patient visit, and how laboratory tests affect the patient LOS in presence of the FCP. The FCP can be adopted relatively easily by any hospitals in the sense that it requires minimal capital expenditure for adoptions. Our modeling framework is general enough to handle the idiosyncrasies of different hospitals. </p>
